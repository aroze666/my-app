      <h2>Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        The fundamentals of music are based on simple physical observations.<br />
        <b>Definition:</b> Frequency is the rate at which something occurs or is
        repeated over a particular period of time or in a given sample. <br />In
        other words, frequency is how fast something vibrates. When an object is
        vibrating, the air surrounding follows and vibrates against our eardrums
        resulting in sounds. Generally, we use frequency as the unit to measure
        the pitch of a sound.

      <h2>Scale (intro)</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps you are familiar with the sequence of sounds: do re mi fa so la
        ti do.
        <br />This is an example of scale. It is called a major scale in music
        theory. To understand how scale is constructed, we also need to know
        about different tuning systems and their origins.

      <h2>Harmony</h2>
      <p>
        In short, harmony is when many sounds are well combined and played at
        the same time. <br />

      <div name="pitchRatioList">
        Here is a list of common ratios for two sounds and given frequency
        example in parentheses.
        <ui>
          <li>1:1 unison. (440, 440)</li>
          <li>2:1 octave. (440, 880)</li>
          <li>3:2 perfect fifth. (440, 660)</li>
          <li>4:3 perfect fourth. (440, 586.67)</li>
          <li>5:3 major sixth. (440, 733.33)</li>
          <li>5:4 major third. (440, 550)</li>
          <li>8:5 minor sixth. (440, 704)</li>
          <li>6:5 minor third. (440, 528)</li>
        </ui>
      </div>
      <p>
        For example if one of our frequency is 440. then 2:1 will be 440 and 880
        playing at the same time. In music theory, chords are constructed using
        the ratios above, but a chord usually contain three or more sounds.
